## Purity from randomized measurements
The purity is reconstructed from statistical correlations between randomized measurements, which are obtained via random single qubit gates

+ [Original Paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6437)
+ [Python Script](PurityRM.py)
+ Typical use: Up to 10 qubits

## Fidelities from randomized measurements
The fidelity between quantum states realized on two different quantum devices is obtained by cross-correlating randomized measurements.

+ [Original Paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.010504)
+ [Python Script](FidelityRM.py)
+ Typical use: Up to 10 qubits

## Purity from importance sampling of randomized measurements
The purity is obtained with exponentially less measurements compared to the standard approach of uniform sampling. This is based on importance sampling of random single qubit unitaries, with respect to an approximation of the quantum state.

+ [Original Paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.200503)
+ [Tutorial](TutorialImportanceSampling.ipynb)
+ [Python Script](PurityImportanceSampling.py)
+ Typical use: Up to 25 qubits

## Topological entanglement entropy from importance sampling of randomized measurements
The topological entanglement entropy "S_topo" is extracted using standard approach of uniform sampling and the new method of importance sampling of random single qubit unitaries, from the modelled approximation of the quantum state.

+ [Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01180.pdf)
+ [Python Script](PurityImportanceSamplingToricCode.py)
+ Typical use: Up to 15 qubits

## Quantum Fisher information using randomized measurements
The Quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be expressed as a converging series of polynomial lower bounds as a function the density matrix and can be measured by the classical shadow formalism. The script in particular shows the extraction of the first two lower bounds.

+ [Original Paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.260501)
+ [Python Script](QFI_classicalshadows.py)
+ Typical use: Up to 10 qubits

## Purity from Common Randomized Measurements (CRM)
We provide enhanced estimation of the purity with lower statistical errors. This is done by executing an offline post-processing of the experimental randomized measurement data wrt a classically simulated randomized measurement data obtained from a theory approximation of the quantum state.        

+ [Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12292.pdf)
+ [Python Script](PurityCRM.py)
+ Typical use: Up to 16 qubits
